# SJR & CORE Rankings Plugin for Zotero 7

A Zotero plugin that automatically displays journal and conference rankings in a custom column in your Zotero library.

## Features

- **Custom "Ranking" Column**: See rankings at a glance without modifying your metadata
- **SJR Journal Rankings**: 30,818+ journals with quartiles (Q1-Q4) and SJR scores
- **CORE Conference Rankings**: 2,107+ conferences (A*, A, B, C) with historical editions
- **Color-Coded Display**: Green (Q1/A*) → Blue (Q2/A) → Orange (Q3/B) → Red (Q4/C)
- **Smart Matching**: 8 fuzzy matching strategies handle title variations and acronyms
- **Automatic Updates**: Rankings appear when items are added or viewed

## Installation

1. Download `sjr-core-rankings-1.1.0.xpi` from the [releases page](releases/)
2. In Zotero 7: Tools → Add-ons → ⚙️ → "Install Add-on From File..."
3. Select the `.xpi` file and restart Zotero
4. Right-click column headers and enable the "Ranking" column

## Usage

Rankings automatically appear in the Ranking column when you view items.

### Manual Check (Coming soon)

To see statistics about ranking matches for selected items:
1. Select one or more items in your library
2. Go to Tools → "Check Rankings for Selected Items"
3. A dialog will show how many were found/not found

Note: This only shows statistics; rankings are always visible in the column.

## Preferences

Access via Edit → Preferences (Zotero → Settings on Mac), then select "Rankings":
- **Auto-Update**: Enable/disable automatic ranking updates
- **CORE Database**: Toggle conference rankings on/off

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x for data extraction scripts
- PowerShell for building the plugin

### Updating Rankings Data

When new SJR or CORE rankings are released:

```bash
cd update-scripts

# Step 1: Extract SJR rankings (from scimagojr CSV)
python extract_sjr.py

# Step 2: Extract CORE rankings (from full_CORE.csv with historical data)
python extract_full_core.py

# Step 3: Combine into plugin data file
python generate_data_js.py
```

This generates the `data.js` file in the plugin directory.

### Building the Plugin

```powershell
cd sjr-core-rankings-zotero-plugin
.\build.ps1
```

This creates `sjr-core-rankings-1.1.0.xpi` ready for installation.
