# Changelog

All notable changes to the SJR & CORE Rankings plugin for Zotero will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.3] - 2025-11-09

### Fixed
- **Manual ranking persistence** - Fixed bug where manual rankings weren't persisting across Zotero restarts
  - Added required third parameter `true` to `Zotero.Prefs.set()` for global preference storage
  - Added robust JSON parsing with fallback for corrupted preference data
  - Manual overrides now correctly saved and loaded on startup
- **Dialog prompt compatibility** - Fixed Zotero 7 compatibility issue with manual ranking dialog
  - Replaced deprecated XPCOM Components API with modern Services API
  - Dialog now displays correctly when setting manual rankings

## [1.1.2] - 2025-11-08

### Added
- **Debug matching mode** - detailed logging shows all matching strategies attempted
- **Manual ranking override** - right-click context menu to manually set rankings for mismatches
- **Column sorting** - rankings now sort correctly in item tree (best to worst)
- **Progress window** - visual feedback when checking rankings for large selections
  - Shows "Checking N items..." with spinner
  - Updates progress every 10 items
  - Displays final statistics with success icon
  - Auto-closes after 3 seconds
- Context menu: "Debug Match for Selected Items" shows detailed algorithm output
- Context menu: "Set Manual Ranking..." allows correcting false positives
- Context menu: "Clear Manual Ranking" reverts to automatic matching
- Manual overrides persist and survive Zotero restarts

### Fixed
- Fixed global variable scope issue preventing plugin from loading
- Fixed menu item not appearing in Tools menu (now uses correct `menu_ToolsPopup` ID)
- Fixed `ZoteroPane is not defined` error when using "Check Rankings" menu item
- **Fixed false positive matches** where unrelated journals were incorrectly matched (e.g., "World Journal of Science and Technology" matching "Journal of Materials Science and Technology")
- **Fixed CORE acronym matching bug** - acronyms now used as last resort only, with safety checks:
  - Acronyms require 4+ characters to avoid ambiguous matches (CSR, AI, ML, IoT, etc.)
  - Detects ambiguous acronyms (multiple conferences with same acronym) and refuses to match
  - Strategy order: Exact → Substring → Word Overlap → Acronym (last)
- Added window tracking to prevent duplicate UI elements
- Column sorting now works correctly with zero-padded numeric prefixes

### Changed
- **Code modularization** - refactored into separate modules for maintainability:
  - `matching.js` - String normalization and ranking match algorithms (265 lines)
  - `overrides.js` - Manual override management with persistent storage (102 lines)
  - `ui-utils.js` - UI helpers for colors, sorting, formatting (147 lines)
  - `rankings.js` - Main plugin coordination and Zotero integration (808 lines, down from 1013)
- Removed unnecessary sandbox/context approach for simpler script loading
- Improved error handling and debug logging
- Menu item now correctly passes window context to ranking checker
- **Improved fuzzy matching algorithm** with stricter criteria:
  - Increased threshold from 70% to 85% overlap (SJR side)
  - Added 80% bidirectional overlap requirement (search side)
  - Increased minimum title length from 4 to 5 significant words
  - Reduces false positives while maintaining legitimate conference proceedings matches
- Ranking cache automatically cleared when manual overrides change

## [1.1.1] - 2025-11-05
Refactoring for initial release

## [1.1.0] - 2025-11-04

### Changed
- **Custom Column Display**: Rankings now appear in a dedicated "Ranking" column instead of the Series field
- Series field is no longer modified by the plugin
- Column can be shown/hidden, resized, and sorted like any built-in column
- Rankings are calculated dynamically when items are displayed

### Added
- Custom column using Zotero.ItemTreeManager.registerColumn() API
- Synchronous ranking calculation for efficient column display
- Column preferences persist between sessions (width, visibility, sort)

### Improved
- Better performance with on-demand ranking calculation
- No longer modifies item metadata
